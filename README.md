## Pin Groups
#### 🛠️ Working protype
The list of layers can get long with.
Using layer groups we can organize things into for example a object-part-channel structure.
To simplify working with groups this can list just the groups in a tree, only keeping the selected one its layers in the timeline.

## Animation Preview
#### 🛠️ Working protype
When aniamting frame by frame we probably need to check the flow of arcs and staying on model usually by flipping back and forth between frames. This can play back frames on the side for a continoeus overview of the animation. 

## Dockers Margin
#### 🛠️ Working protype
The custom panel window borders are compact, this can let dockers breath with wider borders.

## Layer Brushes
#### ✏️ Planning phase
Different brushes can get used in different contexts and can get mixed up over time. This can list what tool was used on a layer

## Count Undo
#### ✏️ Planning phase
There is an agument that erasing and undoing breaks drawing momentum. This can count, delay or block the habit of Ctrl+Z.

## XSheet
#### ✏️ Planning phase
The widgets that makke up horizontal timelines tend to get complicated. This is the more classic list of frames per second.



## Scripts
There are many little function that would be nice to have, fortunatily we can script a lot of them using python. We can even get a little menu with plugin https://krita-artists.org/t/script-runner/126242
